Kerbal Object Inspector
v0.1.0: Release

This software is provided "as-is" with no warranties.

Presented under the GPL v3 license.

Creation and/or publication of media (images, videos, etc.) while using this software is authorized.

The original author, Nifty255, had an ambiguous license reference, he listed two licenses which were 
contradictory.   After consultation with Squad, I have decided to release this using the GPLv3, which
is the original license listed.

In the event that Nifty255 contacts me and requests that I discontinue this mod, I will do so.


This mod is in RELEASE. However, bugs can still happen. If you have a bug, or a suggestion, please leave it in a mature manner.


FEATURES:

Kerbal Object inspector is a plugin which allows mod developers to see exactly what's going on in the background of any game scene by listing every game object and their properties.

- Easy to use interface.
- Lists all game objects, mesh or not.
- Organizes game objects based on the Unity hierarchy. Child objects are displayed indented under parent objects.
- Displays transform and other component information for any game object.
- Efficiently renders a wireframe on any game object with a mesh.
- Objects that are a parent of the selected object have dimmer wireframes.

CHANGELOG:

v1.1.1:
- INITIAL RE-RELEASE for KSP 1.2
